# Semester 5 Lab Codes

Welcome to my Semester 5 Lab Codes repository. This section contains the work I have completed in various lab courses during my fifth semester of the B.Tech program. Each folder is dedicated to a specific lab, containing the questions and corresponding solutions.

## Lab Folders

### 1. [ML Lab](./ML%20Lab)
This folder contains the lab exercises and assignments for the Machine Learning (ML) Lab. The topics covered include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

### 2. [CV Lab](./CV%20Lab)
This folder includes the work done in the Computer Vision (CV) Lab. The exercises involve using OpenCV and other tools to implement various image processing and computer vision techniques.

### 3. [BDA Lab](./BDA%20Lab)
This folder contains the Big Data Analytics (BDA) Lab exercises. The focus here is on working with large datasets, utilizing tools such as Hadoop, Kafka, and other big data technologies.
